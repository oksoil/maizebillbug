\abstract{The maize billbug, \textit{Sphenophoris maidis} (Chittenden) feeds on eastern gamagrass (\textit{Tripsacum dactyloides} (L.) L.), causing economic damage. We studied incidence of \textit{S. maidis} in a six-year-old eastern gamagrass establishment and influence of cumulative growing degree-days (cGDD) on the phenological stages of the pest for two years.Larval, pupal, and adult life stages of the billbug are described and illustrated. Based on growing degree-days, the \text{99\%} quantile for larvae, pupae, and adult maize billbugs was estimated between 1967.8–4234.6 cGDD.Very few pupae were recovered from field sampling, which we relate to short pupation period and weekly sampling interval in our study.  Findings of this study are helpful to formulate sustainable maize billbug management strategies.}

\section{Introduction}

Eastern gamagrass (\textit{Tripsacum dactyloides} (L.) L. [Poaceae]), a distant relative of maize (\textit{Zea mays} L.), is a warm-season perennial C${_4}$ bunchgrass distributed throughout the eastern, central, and southern United States \cite{ref-barkworth07,hitchcock}. The grass is primarily used for forage and hay and was recognized by Magoffin as early as 1843 for its productivity and high-quality palatable forage \cite{hitchcock1899}. There is considerable variation in eastern gamagrass leaf widths, plant heights and widths, disease resistance, forage quality, maturity date, yield, and plant architecture---which is helpful for developing geographically and edaphically widely adapted cultivars \cite{salon2000}. Some of the present eastern gamagrass cultivars include: Pete, Iuka IV, Jackson, Medina Highlander, and Verl \cite{springer04,springer06}. Because of difficulty with establishment, low seed production potential, and overgrazing---declines in its natural population have been reported \cite{rechenthin1951}. Eastern gamagrass is a valued forage for haying and grazing, it provides multiple ecosystem services, such as, phytoremediation \cite{euliss08}, soil amelioration, and soil conservation \cite{gilker02}; and for these reasons, eastern gamagrass has attracted considerable attention among stakeholders in forage and livestock industry \cite{springer04}. Since the eastern gamagrass production area been increasing over the years, pest and diseases are also becoming more abundant and problematic \cite{springer04}.


The billbugs (\textit{Sphenophorus} spp.) are found throughout the continental United States and have been reported to be harmful for range grasses, cool and warm-season turf grasses, and agricultural crops \cite{sattertjwait1931}. Vaurie’s “Revision of the Genus \textit{Sphenophorus} in the United States and Mexico” in 1951 is the most comprehensive taxonomic reference for this genus. Most billbugs are univoltine species, which overwinter as pupae. The genus contains 71 species, with 64 being indigenous to North America \cite{vaurie}. Eleven billbug species infest managed turfgrass in North America, and at least four species are associated with turfgrass in the Midwest, which include bluegrass billbug (\textit{S. parvulus} Gyllenhal), hunting billbug (\textit{S. venatus vestitus}), southern corn billbug (\textit{S. callosus}), lesser billbug (\textit{S. minimus}), and Timothy billbug (\textit{S. inaequalis}) \cite{kuhn12,richmond}. Attention was first given to billbug species during late 1960s when an outbreak of the \textit{S. parvulus} damaged residential lawns across several states \cite{tashiro70}. Often multiple billbug species co-occur infesting turfgrass and identification of larvae to the species level based solely on association with the presence of adults can be difficult and unreliable \cite{duffy18}.

Some of the pests found to affect eastern gamagrass include \textit{Diatraea mitteri} Solis \cite{solis15} and maize billbug [\textit{Sphenophorus maidis} (Chittenden)] \cite{springer06,maas03}. The maize billbug species was first described by Dr. F. H. Chittenden; and as early as 1854 it was  reported to be very destructive to corn (\textit{Zea mays} L.) \cite{kelly1911}. Eastern gamagrass was reported as a host plants of maize billbug by Satterthwait \cite{sattertjwait1931}. Springer et al. \cite{springer04_1} estimated a potential eastern gamagrass yield loss of 1.32 Mg ha$^{-1}$ due to maize billbug infestation, which could significantly reduce forage production and stand longevity. This is equivalent to a loss in eastern gamagrass hay production between 7.4–56.8 USD ha$^{-1}$, with an average of 27.1 USD ha$^{-1}$ (estimates based on 40 USD Mg$^{-1}$)\cite{springer04_1}.



Because so much remains unknown about eastern gamagrass’s pests’ population and life cycle dynamics, predicting outbreak is extremely challenging. Thick and creeping root stocks of the eastern gamagrass provide shelter to various pests. Although eastern gamagrass is considered relatively free of insects, pests, and plant pathogens \cite{krizek04}, taxonomic proximity of eastern gamagrass to maize makes it more susceptible to disease and pests in maize \cite{springer06,maas03}. Adult maize billbugs feed on young shoots of eastern gamagrass, leaving a transverse feeding pattern. Female maize billbugs feed at the base of the culm for ovipositioning and once the eggs hatch, the larvae feed voraciously producing a cavity at the base of the culm, thereby causing extensive damage to the culm base which results in the death of the culm \cite{springer03}. Because knowledge of the life cycle of the maize billbug in eastern gamagrass will be useful for developing cultural practices for control, research was conducted to understand the life stages of development of the maize bill bug in eastern gamagrass. We present and overview of maize billbug ecology, with a focus on extent of seasonal phenology of maize billbug population in eastern gamagrass and to formulate strategies to minimize its damage to eastern gamagrass.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Site description and weather conditions}


This study was conducted at the USDA-ARS Southern Plains Range Research Station (SPRRS), Woodward, OK (36\degree 25’N 99\degree 24’W, elevation 615 m asl), during the year 2003 and 2004. Eastern gamagrass germplasm ‘FGT-1’ \cite{Dewald96} were transplanted in the field in 1996, and spaced at 1.1 m. The soil of the experimental plot was a Devol fine sandy loam (Thermic Typic Haplustalfs). Each year, the plants were burned in mid-March and atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine) at the rate of 1.68 ai ha$^{-1}$ was applied between 7–14 days of burning for weed control. Nitrogen fertilizer in the form of urea was applied to soil at 70 kg N ha$^{-1}$. No insecticides were applied in the field. Beginning in January 2003, four plant crowns were randomly selected and dug each week throughout the year for maize billbug sampling. Plant shoots of the sampled materials were segregated into reproductive and vegetative shoots and the shoots were dissected to determine the presence of maize billbug larvae, pupae, and adult maize billbugs (Figure \ref{fig:MB}). Detailed methods of sampling are published in Springer, et al. \cite{springer11}.The rainfall and daily high and low temperatures and 30–year average climate normal were obtained from an automated weather station located approximately 1 km from the study site (Table \ref{table1}).

\subsection{Cumulative Growing Degree-Days}

Several empirical and experimental evidences have shown that seasonal biology and population dynamics of insects are primarily regulated by temperature. Growing Degree-Days (GDD) is a commonly used measure of thermal accumulation, as the mechanistic link between ambient air temperature, which serves as a proxy for growing conditions within a region, and species phenology. GDD explicitly constraints the thermal limits within which growth is possible. Therefore, GDD has been extensively used to predict phenology by agriculturists, entomologists, and ecologists \cite{higley86}. We used the following canonical equation (\ref{eq:1}) to calculate growing degree-days (GDD) for each year using the weather data measured at the SPRRS station.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
GDD= \sum \left [ \frac{T_{max}+T_{min}}{2} -T_{base}\right ]
\end{equation}

Where T$_{max}$ is the daily maximum air temperature, T$_{min}$ is the daily minimum air temperature, and T$_{base}$ is the temperature below which the process of the species does not progress. We used a minimum threshold of 10\degree C and a maximum of 30\degree C to calculate GDD from a biofix date of January 1 using the daily maximum and minimum ambient temperature recorded for the site. All analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). We used PROC UNIVARIATE to obtain descriptive statistics for cumulative growing degree-days (cGDD) for each life stage 




\section{Results and Discussion}

Larvae, pupae, and adult comprised 30.2, 8.3 and \text{61.4\%} of the total sampled population respectively. The \text{99\%} quantile for larvae, pupae, and adult maize billbugs was estimated between 1967.8–3514.3 cGDD for 2003 and 2040.9–4234.6 for 2004 (Table \ref{table2}). The first captures of \textit{S. maidis’}s larvae, pupae, and adult were recorded as early as DOY 169, 190, and 7 for 2003 and DOY 175, 189, and 14 for 2004 respectively. Larval stage in maize billbug ranges from 32–75 days depending upon the weather and host plants \cite{hayes1916}. Similarly, a three-year study in maize billbug under laboratory conditions reported varying larval stages (33–70), with an average larval period of 49.15 days \cite{cwright1929}. In our study, larvae were found between DOY 169–239 (Jun 17–Aug 26) which translates to 900–1957 cGDD. This is similar to that reported by Hayes \cite{hayes1916} for corn in southern Kansas (June through early September) and Carrwright \cite{cwright1929} in South Carolina. Histogram of the cGDD shows that peak larva occurrence was observed around 1200 cGDD in 2003 and 1500 cGDD in 2004 (Figures \ref{fig:f1} and \ref{fig:f2}).

Pupae were collected between 1150–1450 cGDD and 1850–2150 cGDD both years, between 7 June and 9 Sept. The length of the pupation stage in corn can vary annually, ranging between 9–30 days, depending upon the weather \cite{hayes1916}. Pupation period is short in a dry season and long in a wet season \cite{hayes1916}. Likewise, Cartwright \cite{cwright1929} reported a three-year average pupal period of 9.86 days (minimum 8 days, maximum 15 days) under laboratory conditions. Hayes \cite{hayes1916} reported maize billbug’s pupae in maize between mid-July through early September. Similarly, Cartwright \cite{cwright1929} reported finding maize billbug from mid-July through mid-October. In general, pupae were difficult to recover. As stated earlier, pupation in corn varies between 9 and 30 days depending upon the weather, it may be possible that the pupation period is less for eastern gamagrass due to the fact that our sampling interval was every seven days and very few pupae were recovered during sampling. Adult maize billbugs were collected throughout the year during both seasons (Figures \ref{fig:f1} and \ref{fig:f2}).

Larvae, pupae, and adult populations were greater in reproductive shoots compared with vegetative shoots. No pupae were collected in vegetative shoots. However, larvae and adult populations in the reproductive shoot were 1.28 and 3.2 times greater than their corresponding population in vegetative shoots (Figure \ref{fig:f3}). 




The nutritive value of eastern gamagrass is superior to corn, with lipid and protein contents being 1.5 and 3 times greater than that of corn respectively \cite{bargman89}. The amount of total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) in eastern gamagrass are highest during the winter dormant season and least during May and June \cite{dewald_kd}. A study conducted from 1993 through 1997 at the USDA-ARS SPRRS quantified the nutritive value of eastern gamagrass and found varying levels of nitrogen content; ranging from 2.3–3.1\text{\%}(14.6–19.6\text{\%} crude protein) in May to 0.8–1.2\text{\%}(5.3–7.6\text{\%} crude protein) in August \cite{gillen99}. It is known that high-protein diet allows for rapid development of larvae compared with than larvae surviving on low-protein diet, for e.g., Woods \cite{woods99} reported that fifth-instar Manduca sexta caterpillars reared on a high–protein diet (17.7\text{\%} casein by dry weight) grew 20\text{\%} more rapidly than caterpillars reared on a low-protein diet (5.9\text{\%} casein by dry weight). Similarly, Karowe and Martin \cite{karowe89} demonstrated that growth and survivorship of southern armyworm (Spodoptera erodania), prior to the onset of the fifth instar, were dependent upon the amount of protein diet. They reported that diets with 3.4–4.7\text{\%} nitrogen (20.9–30.5\text{\%} crude protein) resulted in the highest larval dry weight and survivorship (96–100\text{\%}) weight. Therefore, \textit{S. maidis} larvae appear to time their onset of stage and stabilize their relative growth rate when protein availability is relatively higher in eastern gamagrass.

Adults are strong and vigorous, having few natural enemies. Adults remain protected during most part of their existence, either inside the plant crown or under the dead plant materials in the field. They can also survive underwater for several days in case of heavy rains and field flooding. On average eggs incubate somewhere between 8–12 days. Dry weather expedites eggs development thereby shortening the incubation period, whereas wet weather prolongs the development time \cite{hayes20}. 

Development of resistant eastern gamagrass cultivars with fine stems and leaves and tougher plant tissues, paired with IPM control strategies could be effective. Dupuy and Ramirez \cite{dupuy16} did a review on the biology and control of billbugs and described several cultural, biological, and chemical control methods for billbug management, with most focus on turfgrass. Due to lack of systemic insecticides labeled for eastern gamagrass and the  sheltered feeding habit of maize billbug, it  will be extremely difficult to control \cite{kuhn12}. Application of insecticides would be cost prohibitive and the cheapest and most effective means of maize billbug control is crop rotation \cite{cwright1929}. Natural enemies of maize billbug include \textit{Anaphoidea calandrae} Gahan that feed on their eggs, \textit{Cerceris bicornuta}, a wasp, that prey on adult maize billbug and take them to its nest for feeding its larvae, and parasitic fungus that cause mortality at any stage of its growth \cite{vaurie}.

\section{Conclusions}

The following summary is based largely upon observations made on the SPRRS station in Woodward, Oklahoma, but we believe that the same observations would be valid in the Southern Great Plains region. The developmental findings of our study suggest that lower threshold temperatures in maize billbug are likely to restrict its larval and pupal population under current climatic parameters. Adult population occur throughout the season. We believe, for optimal management strategy of billbug population, a spatio-temporal analysis will be necessary to establish a sound understanding and prediction of billbug seasonal activity. In addition, novel methods for studying the development from egg to adult under laboratory settings are imperative to fully understand the life-cycle of the pest and unravel information on sex ratio, female lifespan and fecundity, as well as larval biology.

Some of the control strategies include preventive application of contact and systemic insecticides targeting overwintering adult population before they oviposition during the spring. Burning of the eastern gamagrass residue in the spring followed by nitrogen fertilizer application could also be helpful in controlling maize billbug. Our study will be useful in improving the maize billbug’s scouting efficiency and forecasting of the seasonal occurrence of maize billbug in eastern gamagrass. In conclusion, we still have a fragmentary understanding of the maize billbug, creating demand for more research in all areas of its biology. Since the experiment was conducted in a field condition, it was harder to keep records of larval instars and their moulting because of the limited population encountered technical expertise in properly discriminating larval stages. Further research is needed in order to enlighten the underinvestigated life-cycle stages and its activity at various phenological stages and for the development of control and management mechanism that fits well with an IPM approach.
